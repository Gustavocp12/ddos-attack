# DDoS Simulation Tool

A simple Python script to simulate high traffic to a server for stress testing and educational purposes. The tool sends multiple simultaneous requests to analyze how a server handles load under pressure.

## Disclaimer

This tool is intended for **educational purposes only** and must only be used on servers you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized usage is illegal, and the author assumes no responsibility for misuse.

## How It Works

The script utilizes Python's threading to generate concurrent HTTP requests to a target server, logging response times and status codes for analysis.
